Life sometimes stays the same like an endless drone. We may find ourself at crossroads with pulling the trigger on a lifechanging decisions. 
The dilemma is that we recognize this decision may be an agent for good or bad in our life. 

The hesitation to flip the coin and call it is feared imensely during these times.

Having so much on stake is one part of the problem. But having visited this sort of situation before and having left scathed by it, is a different story.
Its the fear of having to go through another round of suffering for making an incorrect decision.

But we forget that for the most part a good life lesson is waiting on the other side. Even if it is completely unrelated to the situation itself. 
I guess that becoming laser focussed at the consequeces of the wrong decisions makes us so tuned, that our instincts kick in.

But I digress. What I feel is that sometimes its healthy to just call it and go with the 50/50 chances everyone has. What we are responsible for is making sure the likelihood of success increase with constant effort. Those are lucky who show up. And those who show up, Call it reularly no matter their situation.
