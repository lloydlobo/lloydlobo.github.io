Less is more. Its a popular saying and in its own right apt.

Two words that comes to my mind when I hear this aare contentment and hunger.
They may sound like polar opposites when put together, but they fit the saying for me.

I have noticed that having more than enough and some more, dulls the want to work. Altough having an abundant mindset is different from being abundant in a physical aspect.

Lets say people win a lottery with a huge amount of money. Would they want to work again? Initially in most cases the answer would be no. This isoften seen with reall lottery winners. They are known to gamble or spend aaway that money and often end up in debt and misery.

Hsving a lot of money, makes the person lose the idrive to work. Joy usually doesn't come from having more but from working on things which you are good at or which benefits the others.

Also, having less or should I say, the essentials is a key to peace of mind. Not having things to weigh you down and be dependent on them is a major aspect of freedom. 

If you don't believe me look how Uncle Scrooge turned out.
