Sometimes it is unrealistic to keep a vow of a daily goal. When we look up on our idols, we see them perform consistently.
But was this always the same. Did they not toil hard to reach that state. 

I missed writing this blog for a few days due to obligations and change of focus on other avenues of work. Its good to often shake things up and get out of a rut.

Beating yourself up for not keeping up with your personal commitments isn't helping anyone. Its wise to get back into the game while there is still a fascination with it. 

And, I've learned that making up for lost time by working extra hard is destructive. It either dulls down the drive for work or the work itself. 

See you in the next post.
