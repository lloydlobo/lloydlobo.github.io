Excerpts about the most important blog post from Seth Godin's blog: 

> It is on the most important blog. 
Yours. 
Even if no one but you reads it. The blog you write each day is the blog you need the most. It’s a 	compass and a mirror, a chance to put a stake in the ground and refine your thoughts. 
And the most important post? The one you’ll write tomorrow.

## The First Step is the Hardest
I have noticed that starting with something is always a challenge. If it was easy then we would have done it by now. 

## Write for yourself first
One price of advice that I keep seeing a lot is that write such that your future self will want to read it again. This advice holds true when you are starting out. It cuts down the factor of - tailoring your message for the masses. I feel that once you get into the flow of creating several blog posts, your audience will respond favorably to the best of you. 
This Cuts down filtering and you leave it for your audience to decide.

## Turn off your inner critic
While composing a price of music, I have found that my best work came while I was jamming to a song or just noodling around with instruments.
But if I start playing the role of editor while playing the flow of creation gets erratic and comes to a halt. 
The same may apply to writing. This doesn't mean you do not have a goal or standards with what you put down on paper or screen. 

### Why is this so important?

We are our own worst critics. Writers tend to be hard on themselves and this positionality usually comes when they critique their own work

So, if you have started writing, simply keep writing and don't stop to correct things, which can easily be done with more precision afterwards.

## 50 First Rough-Posts
To get a head start, make a commitment to yourself that your first 50 posts will be a rough article. This way you are treading the waters and seeing what you like to express. We eventually find that it's okay to have some good days and some bad days of creative output.

### Atomic Notes

I like to use Atomic Notes to build up my content. Even a single atomic note can lead up to a blog post.
