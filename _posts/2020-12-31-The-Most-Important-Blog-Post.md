From Seth Godin's blog: 

It is on the most important blog.
Yours.

Even if no one but you reads it. The [[blog]] you write each day is the blog you need the most. It’s a 	compass and a mirror, a chance to put a stake in the ground and refine your thoughts.

And the most important post? The one you’ll write tomorrow.
