Great artists in the music industry churn out a lot of music. This is because as soon as they compose and write, they record and release it ASAP.

Having a daily blog makes this a possibility for anyone.

There is no element of friction from external sources unlike in other industries. You need a device to type on and an internet connection.

In the case of a daily blog, writing more often leads to writing better. Repetition matter more in this case.
There is a reason it takes 10,000 hours of practice to master any skill. And a daily blog is the next best thing to cultivate the amount of repetition required.

I start this journey, keeping few important and necessary things in mind. One of them is that perfection is the enemy for consistent output. Besides imperfections make the best art pieces for their imperfections.

It all comes down to persistent practice.
