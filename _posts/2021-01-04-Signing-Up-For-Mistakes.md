In high stakes sports a single mistake may cost the player the game. One small error builds up into a massive defeat.

In the wild we anticipated the same kind of errors and the price to pay for them, if there is a mistake. But often in order to avoid that, we started to stop trying and bypassed the mistake itself.

But this meant, we held ourselves back from pushing to our limits, and transcending what has been said and done. 

The earlier we understand that if we have taken the role of doing something exceptional, then we have signed up for mistakes. There is no way around it. You can't have the pie and eat it too. Innovating requires a price to be paid.

When we look at experts in a field we are looking at a finished product, so to speak. But we haven't noticed the countless mistakes made to get to greatness. The attitude of learning from such mistakes is all that matters.

Make Mistake. Accept. Learn. Improvise.
