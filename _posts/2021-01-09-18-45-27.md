Henry Ford famously said that "Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs".
It is unreasonable to say that nothing is hard and everything is doable.
But, when it is broken down into smaller tasks, then the whole seems less daunting than before.

We get a fix when we check of tasks from our To Do losts. No matter the time or effort it required each time we check them off it gives a boost to our sense of mastery.

But there are some projects which never end and seem to be unattainable. They require a high level of willpower and energy to be completed.

Do not forget about the difficulties of being in flow when attempting such tasks, due to the enormity of it.

But if we break those large projects down into smaller bite sized tasks, then everything starts to seem within grasp. And soon as we start doing them a momentum builds up along with feel good dopamine hit after each task is finished.

This breaking down to the basic elements works with anything unattainable or hard. Focusing on one area, one day at a time is the key.
