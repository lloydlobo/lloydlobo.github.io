Movies adore the underdog, the sideline player who arrives at the right time and does the unimaginable. The opponent don't take them seriously but the team mates know their value and aren't threatened for their own playing spots.

The best ideas are borne in the sidelines. Ever found yourself in a brainstorming session with pressure to come up with good ideas? Have you noticed the ones which shine came from the scribbling you made to remember for later. These sideline ideas we have without pressure or deadlines seem to make up for the best ones. Because the stakes are low and our defenses are down. 

Cherishing the fillers in every aspect of our life is something one should learn. You never know which sideline coal may turn out to be a diamond in the rough.
