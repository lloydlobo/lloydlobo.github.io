## Showing Up
- Showing up is half the battle. 
- Environment affects it. Setting it up the previous day or task makes the transition smooth.
	- After each task reset everything to neutral

### Like begets Like
Like begets like is the natural process of Evolution's Selfish Gene.

That means whatever you do, whatever tiny action or thought, creates neural pathways; and neural pathways strengthen with use (see: The neural formation of habits is additive).
