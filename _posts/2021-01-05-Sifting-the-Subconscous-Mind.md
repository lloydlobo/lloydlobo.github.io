Effective and successful people have been known to focus on projects which have a great chance to succeed. It is a knack that they have perfected. They also make sure that they ignore the projects which have a less probability of success. 

This is improved upon by, what Seth Godin refers to as [pre-filtering](https://seths.blog/2020/11/subconscious-pre-filtering/). I like the term sifting better, because only the essentials can go through.
This sifting works great when done expressively and loud. 

Writing down what factors you want using tools like mind map, outlines. 
Explaining it to a colleague or friend about how your niche works does the trick too. 

When you exclusively work on these prompts with intuition on your side, the results are brilliant.
