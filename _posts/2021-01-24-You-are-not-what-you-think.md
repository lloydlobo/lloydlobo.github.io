It might come as a surprise to people, who think they have themself all figured out by the title of this post. We may think that what we think that we are. But quite often that is not the case.

There is a hidden deep seated persona which is hiding within our subconscious. This mixes up in our decision or interpretation for the next one. We may think we have free will, but that may not be the case. If we trace back each of our decisions, it is always biased to the consequences of the previous decision and learning from it. 
If thats the case then even a new born child is programmed with survival courtesy of their genes. Hence, everything is a ripple effect of the previous action. 

Now, we may think that all our decisions are made in real time governed by our sets of rules and logic. Even decisions made with emotions always are clouded with irationality.

Understanding this may not be a major feat as this is always a work in motion.
