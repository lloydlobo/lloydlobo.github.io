<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hi. I’m Lloyd Lobo. I am a Copywriter, Music Composer, Audo Engineer, Web Designer.

I’ve been trying to turn on lights, inspire people and teach them how to level up. I have been inspired by Seth Godin's daily blog and wish to make that hapen over here. One day, if we meet, I hope you’ll share with me your favorite posts. Even better, I’d like to hear about how a book or course helped you interact with the world differently and make a difference.
